    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Bolognese sauce (UK: /ˌbɒləˈneɪz, -ˈnɛz/, US: /ˌboʊlənˈjeɪz, -ˈniz/;[1] known in Italian as ragù alla bolognese, pronounced [raˈɡu alla boloɲˈɲeːse, -eːze], ragù bolognese, or simply ragù) is a meat-based sauce in Italian cuisine, typical of the city of Bologna. It is customarily used to dress tagliatelle al ragù and to prepare lasagne alla bolognese.</p>
    <p>Genuine ragù alla bolognese is a slowly cooked meat-based sauce, and its preparation involves several techniques, including sweating, sautéing and braising. Ingredients include a characteristic soffritto of onion, celery and carrot, different types of minced or finely chopped beef, often alongside small amounts of fatty pork. White wine, milk, and a small amount of tomato paste or tomatoes are added, and the dish is then gently simmered at length to produce a thick sauce.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds lean ground beef</li>
        <li>1 large white onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 large portobello mushroom, diced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 (14.5 ounce) cans petite diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>3 (10 ounce) cans condensed tomato soup</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons garlic and herb seasoning blend (such as Mrs. Dash®)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chili powder (Optional)</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons Cajun seasoning (Optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the ground beef in a large pot over high heat, stirring quickly and constantly until completely browned 7 to 10 minutes. Stir the onion into the beef; cook and stir until the onion begins to turn translucent, about 5 minutes more. Drain excess grease from meat mixture. Add the mushroom to the mixture; allow to cook until it begins to soften, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the diced tomatoes and tomato soup into the pot, stir, reduce heat to medium, and bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add the Worcestershire sauce, garlic and herb seasoning blend, lemon juice, garlic, chili powder, Cajun seasoning, basil, vanilla extract, black pepper, and salt to the mixture, stirring each into the mixture before adding the next. Reduce heat to low and allow the mixture to simmer for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Add the spaghetti and olive oil to the pot and cook the pasta at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain. Top with the Bolognese sauce to serve.</li>
    </ol>
